# VehicularEdgeComputing
This repository consists of the implementations of 7 Vehicular Edge Computing Algorithms in Python. 

Note: Some of the algorithms require the user to have a free license for Gurobi solver, this is required to obtain the optimal values for certain variables. The free license can be obtained from https://www.gurobi.com/
